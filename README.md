phase-utils
===========

Perl 5.? scripts used to handle the results of PHASE.  

These were used primarily during the exploration of rRNA secondary structure based phylogenetic analyses, with results summarized under the [jRNA website, now archived with the Species File Group][0].  They were authored by Matthew Yoder.

These scripts are no longer maintained.
